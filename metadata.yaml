description: "Tik-Tok of Oz is the eighth Land of Oz book written by L. Frank Baum,\
  \ published on June 19, 1914. The book actually has little to do with Tik-Tok and\
  \ is primarily the quest of the Shaggy Man (introduced in The Road to Oz) to rescue\
  \ his brother, and his resulting conflict with the Nome King.\nThe endpapers of\
  \ the first edition held maps: one of Oz itself, and one of the continent on which\
  \ Oz and its neighboring countries belonged. These were the first maps printed of\
  \ Oz.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
